## Overview
The Fairy Works website is a simple HTML-based project designed to showcase the services and portfolio of a photography business. It includes sections for navigation, a biography, a gallery, and a list of services offered.

## File Structure
- **HTML File**: Contains the main structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS File** (referenced as `style.css`): Handles the styling of the website (not provided in the HTML code snippet).
- **Images**: Image files are referenced in the `Gallery` section and should be stored in an `images` folder.

## Features
1. **Header and Navigation**:
   - A prominent header displays the business name: "Fairy Works."
   - A navigation bar with links to key sections:
     - Home
     - Services

2. **Biography Section**:
   - Provides information about the mission and passion of the business.
   - Focuses on the power of photography and its role in capturing memories.

3. **Gallery Section**:
   - Displays a collection of images to highlight the photography portfolio.
   - Images are placed in a responsive grid layout using columns.

4. **Services Section**:
   - Lists the services offered by the business:
     - Space photography
     - Portrait photography
     - Event photography

5. **Footer**:
   - Includes copyright information.
   - A "Back to Top" link for smooth navigation.

## How to Use
1. Save the HTML code to a file named `index.html`.
2. Create a `style.css` file for custom styling (if desired).
3. Place the required image files (`download.jpeg`, `download (1).jpeg`, `download (2).jpeg`) in an `images` folder within the same directory as the HTML file.
4. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the website.

## Future Improvements
- Add more interactive elements using JavaScript (e.g., a carousel for the gallery).
- Enhance styling with CSS to make the design more visually appealing and responsive.
- Include more detailed descriptions and links in the navigation bar.

## Dependencies
- No external libraries or frameworks are used. The project is built with plain HTML and CSS.
